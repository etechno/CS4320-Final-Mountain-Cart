# CS4320-Final-Mountain-Cart

Mountain cart is a machine learning toy problem. In this problem, a cart is in a valley between two hills, its goal is to get to the top of the rightmost hill. Its engine isn't strong enough to make it up the steep slope, so it must build momentum. Further details of the problem can be found here: https://gym.openai.com/envs/MountainCar-v0/

The agents are all made of a neural net composed of 3 densely connected layers.  A video of the agents performing a run can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DABzX5Zm9u0
